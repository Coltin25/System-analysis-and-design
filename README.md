Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a hypothetical company that wants to provide updated dmv classes that help all students to require training. The concept was a website that students could book appointment and packages for to receive training on driving.

What did you do particularly well?
I created multiple types of UML diagrams to break down the different systems that would be required for DriverPass to be functional.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my System design document to break down each activity with an activity UML. I would have attempted to create a diagram for every component within the DriverPass website.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When I develop a software its important to understand how its going to get used. I often test out my own designs to validate that what is required for a finished product is provided. If the user cant use the software then theres no point to have made it in the first place.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I Utilize a straight to the point attitude with no cutting corners and providing as much detail as possible in as few words that I can.
